# D-Flip-Flop-Basic-Operation-Verification
A SystemVerilog project demonstrating the design and verification of a D Flip-Flop (DFF). The DFF captures input on the rising clock edge and resets asynchronously. Includes a class-based testbench with generator, driver, monitor, and scoreboard for functional validation and waveform generation.
